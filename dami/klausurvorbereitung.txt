- Types of data
    - Structured
        - Relational Records
        - Tables
    - Sequential and semi-structured
        - Documents with text data
        - Video Data
        - Temporal data
        ...
    - Graph and Network
        - World wide web 
        - Molecular Structures
- Data objects
    - Described by attributes
    - database rows-> data objects
    - database columns -> attributes
- Attributes
    - Types:
        - Nominal
            - categories, states, names
        - Binary
            - symmetric binary -> both outcomes equally important
            - asymmetric binary -> outcomes not equally important
        - Numeric
            - values with meaningful order, but no magnitude between them
                -> small, medium, large
                -> grades
    -Numeric attribute types
        - Quantity
        - Interval
        - Ratio
    - Discrete Attribute
        - finite or countable infinite set of valous
    - Continuous Attribute
        - continuous values
    - Static, temporal attributes (self explaining)
    - Experimental, observational Data (self explaining)
- Dimensionality
    - Exponential increase of data points with increasing dimensionality to achieve the same density of data
    - A larger radius is needed to enclose the same fraction of data points in a high-dimensional space
        e(p)=p^(1/d)

        p: pre-sepcified fraction of sample
        d: number of dimensions

    - Almost every point is closer to an edge than to another samplepoint in high-dimensional space.
        D(d,n)=1/2 * (1/n)^(1/d)
        
        D: expected distance
        d: dimensional space
        n: sample size

- Preparing Data
    - standart form is relational table
    - preprocessing
    - dimensionality reduction

- Measuring the Central Tendency
    - Mean: Usual average
    - Median: Middle value
    - Mode: Value that occurs most often in the data
    - Quartiles: Q1=25% , Q3=75%
    - Inter-quartile range: IQR=Q3-Q1
    - Five number summary: min, Q1, median, Q3, max
    
    - Boxplot
        - Ends of the box are quartiles
        - median is marked
        - outlier are individually
            - usually a value higher/lower than 1.5 * IQR
        - Whiskers mark Minimum and Maximum

- Outlier Detection
    - Build profile of `normal` behavior
    - Check for outliers with previous profile

    Graphical approach:
        - Boxplot
        - Scatter plot
    Statistical approach:
        - Data distribution
        - Parameter of distribution
        - Number of expected outliers
        
        Limitations:
            - Most are for a single attribute
            - data distribution may be unknown
            - difficulties to estimate distribution in high dimensional data
    
    Distance based approaches
        - Nearest Neighbor-based
        - Density-based
        - Clustering-based

- Minkowski Distance
